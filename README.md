Created this project to work on the Advent of Code (AoC) challeneg in December 2023, created by Eric Wastl. 

The introduction below is taken from AoC website `About` Section as they explain it best:

AoC is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; 
every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

You can find out more about AoC [here](https://adventofcode.com/about) and support them by donating for the time and effort they put in!

The data is mostly being added using .txt files which I can store on a GoogleDrive and Share. Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/schitransh/).
