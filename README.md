Created this project to work on the Advent of Code challeneg in December 2023, created by Eric Wastl. 

The introduction below is taken from Advent of Code website About Section as they explain it best:

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; 
every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
