    "The puzzle is such that there are numbers with periods in the middle separating them. There are also symbols (other than periods) that exist around the input. Any number next to or around a symbol (above, below, beside or diagnolly next to) is considered a relevant number and should be summed to create the final answer. Note that for this calculation, periods are not considered symbols. An example is given below:\n",
